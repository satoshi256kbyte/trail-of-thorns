# Requirements Document

## Introduction

2DシミュレーションRPGプロジェクトにおける管理画面（データエディター）の開発要件を定義します。この管理画面は、ゲームデータ（キャラクター、アイテム、ステージ等）をGUIで編集し、JSONファイルとして出力する機能を提供します。React + TypeScriptで構築され、ローカル環境で動作し、編集されたデータはプルリクエストを通じてゲーム本体に統合されます。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to manage character data through a visual interface, so that I can efficiently create and modify game characters without directly editing JSON files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a character management interface
2. WHEN I create a new character THEN the system SHALL provide form fields for name, stats, abilities, and sprite information
3. WHEN I save character data THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields and data types
4. WHEN I export character data THEN the system SHALL generate a valid JSON file in the correct format
5. IF character data is invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with specific field information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to manage item and equipment data, so that I can create a balanced inventory system for the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the item management section THEN the system SHALL display categories for weapons, armor, consumables, and key items
2. WHEN I create a new item THEN the system SHALL provide fields for name, description, stats, rarity, and icon
3. WHEN I set item effects THEN the system SHALL allow selection from predefined effect types with parameter inputs
4. WHEN I save item data THEN the system SHALL validate stat values are within acceptable ranges
5. IF item references are broken THEN the system SHALL highlight dependency issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to create and edit stage/map data, so that I can design engaging game levels with proper enemy placement and objectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the stage editor THEN the system SHALL display a visual grid-based map editor
2. WHEN I place objects on the map THEN the system SHALL provide drag-and-drop functionality for tiles, enemies, and items
3. WHEN I configure stage properties THEN the system SHALL allow setting of victory conditions, enemy spawn points, and environmental effects
4. WHEN I save stage data THEN the system SHALL generate coordinate-based JSON with all placed objects
5. IF stage data conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL prevent saving and show conflict resolution options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to preview data changes in real-time, so that I can see how modifications will appear in the actual game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I modify any game data THEN the system SHALL show a live preview of the changes
2. WHEN I edit character stats THEN the system SHALL display calculated derived values (HP, damage, etc.)
3. WHEN I change item properties THEN the system SHALL show the item's visual representation
4. WHEN I modify stage layouts THEN the system SHALL render a minimap preview
5. IF preview data cannot be generated THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder with error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the admin dashboard to integrate with the development workflow, so that data changes can be properly reviewed and deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I export data THEN the system SHALL generate JSON files in the exact format expected by the game engine
2. WHEN data is exported THEN the system SHALL create a structured directory matching the game's data folder layout
3. WHEN I validate exported data THEN the system SHALL run schema validation against all generated files
4. WHEN integration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide instructions for creating pull requests
5. IF exported data fails validation THEN the system SHALL prevent export and display detailed error reports

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to import existing game data, so that I can continue editing previously created content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import existing JSON files THEN the system SHALL parse and load all compatible data formats
2. WHEN import is successful THEN the system SHALL populate all editor interfaces with the loaded data
3. WHEN import encounters errors THEN the system SHALL show detailed error messages with line numbers
4. WHEN I import partial data THEN the system SHALL merge with existing data without overwriting unrelated content
5. IF imported data has schema mismatches THEN the system SHALL offer migration options or manual correction interfaces

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to manage data relationships and dependencies, so that I can maintain consistency across all game content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I reference other data objects THEN the system SHALL provide dropdown selections from available items
2. WHEN I delete referenced data THEN the system SHALL warn about dependent objects and offer cascade options
3. WHEN data relationships are broken THEN the system SHALL highlight issues in a dependency report
4. WHEN I update referenced data THEN the system SHALL automatically update all dependent references
5. IF circular dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL prevent creation and suggest alternative structures
