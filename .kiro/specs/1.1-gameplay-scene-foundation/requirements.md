# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the foundational gameplay scene system for the SRPG, providing the core infrastructure for turn-based tactical combat. The GameplayScene will serve as the main game environment where players engage in strategic battles on grid-based maps with character units.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to enter a gameplay scene from the stage selection, so that I can start playing the actual SRPG battle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player selects a stage from the stage selection screen THEN the system SHALL transition to the GameplayScene
2. WHEN the GameplayScene loads THEN the system SHALL display the selected stage map with proper grid layout
3. WHEN the GameplayScene initializes THEN the system SHALL load and position all characters according to stage data
4. IF the stage data is invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL display an error message and return to stage selection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a clear game interface during battle, so that I can understand the current game state and available actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GameplayScene is active THEN the system SHALL display the current turn number
2. WHEN it's a player's turn THEN the system SHALL show whose turn it is (player/enemy)
3. WHEN the GameplayScene is running THEN the system SHALL provide accessible menu buttons (pause, settings)
4. WHEN a character is selected THEN the system SHALL display character information panel
5. WHEN the game state changes THEN the system SHALL update all UI elements accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth camera controls, so that I can navigate around the battlefield effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player uses keyboard controls THEN the camera SHALL move smoothly across the map
2. WHEN the player uses mouse controls THEN the camera SHALL follow mouse movement appropriately
3. WHEN the camera reaches map boundaries THEN the system SHALL prevent camera movement beyond the map edges
4. WHEN the player uses zoom controls THEN the camera SHALL zoom in/out with smooth transitions
5. WHEN a character performs an action THEN the camera SHALL automatically focus on the relevant area

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to manage turns automatically, so that I can focus on tactical decisions rather than game mechanics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GameplayScene starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the turn order based on character speed stats
2. WHEN a player completes their turn THEN the system SHALL automatically advance to the next character
3. WHEN all player characters have acted THEN the system SHALL switch to enemy turn
4. WHEN all enemy characters have acted THEN the system SHALL start a new player turn
5. WHEN the turn changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the current turn state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to interact with characters on the battlefield, so that I can make tactical decisions and execute actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player clicks on a friendly character THEN the system SHALL select that character and show available actions
2. WHEN a character is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight possible movement areas
3. WHEN the player clicks on an enemy character THEN the system SHALL display enemy information
4. WHEN it's not the player's turn THEN the system SHALL disable character selection and movement
5. WHEN a character has already acted THEN the system SHALL indicate this visually and prevent further actions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular and extensible scene architecture, so that additional gameplay features can be easily integrated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the GameplayScene THEN the system SHALL use a component-based architecture
2. WHEN adding new gameplay systems THEN the system SHALL support easy integration without major refactoring
3. WHEN the scene needs to communicate with other systems THEN the system SHALL use event-driven patterns
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging and debug information
5. WHEN testing the scene THEN the system SHALL support unit and integration testing
