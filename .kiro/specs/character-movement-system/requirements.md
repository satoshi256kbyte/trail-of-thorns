# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the core character movement system for the SRPG, enabling players to move their units across the tactical grid during their turn. The system includes movement range calculation, pathfinding, visual feedback, and movement execution with proper turn-based constraints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to select a character and see their movement range, so that I can plan tactical positioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player clicks on their character THEN the system SHALL highlight all tiles within movement range
2. WHEN displaying movement range THEN the system SHALL use different colors for reachable vs unreachable tiles
3. WHEN a character has already moved this turn THEN the system SHALL not display movement options
4. WHEN it's the enemy turn THEN the system SHALL not allow player character selection for movement

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see the optimal path to my destination, so that I can understand movement costs and plan efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player hovers over a reachable tile THEN the system SHALL display the movement path
2. WHEN calculating paths THEN the system SHALL use the shortest route considering terrain costs
3. WHEN multiple paths exist with equal cost THEN the system SHALL choose the most direct route
4. WHEN a path is blocked by other units THEN the system SHALL find alternative routes or show no path

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to execute character movement smoothly, so that the game feels responsive and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player clicks on a valid destination THEN the character SHALL move along the calculated path
2. WHEN moving THEN the character SHALL animate smoothly from tile to tile
3. WHEN movement is complete THEN the character SHALL face the direction of their last movement
4. WHEN movement is in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent other actions until complete

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want movement to respect terrain and unit collision, so that tactical positioning matters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating movement THEN the system SHALL apply terrain-based movement costs
2. WHEN a tile is occupied by another unit THEN the system SHALL treat it as impassable
3. WHEN terrain is impassable THEN the system SHALL exclude it from movement calculations
4. WHEN movement would exceed the character's movement points THEN the system SHALL prevent the action

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to cancel movement selection, so that I can change my mind during planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player right-clicks during movement selection THEN the system SHALL cancel movement mode
2. WHEN a player clicks on the same character again THEN the system SHALL deselect the character
3. WHEN a player selects a different character THEN the system SHALL switch to the new character's movement
4. WHEN movement is cancelled THEN the system SHALL clear all movement highlights and paths

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the movement system to integrate with the turn system, so that movement respects game rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a character moves THEN the system SHALL mark them as having moved this turn
2. WHEN a turn ends THEN the system SHALL reset all movement flags for the next player
3. WHEN a character has both moved and acted THEN the system SHALL mark their turn as complete
4. WHEN all characters have completed their turns THEN the system SHALL advance to the next turn
